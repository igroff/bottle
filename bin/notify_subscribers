# in this one without having included files re-include the includes :)

# Any files in the directory where this script is running that match *.inc
# will be in the order returned from the expansion of *.inc, so alphabetical
# ordering.  Thus if you wish to control the order more explicitly you can
# name your includes 01_*.inc, 02_*.inc and so on.
